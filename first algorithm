If an algorithm is a set of steps we can carry out ourselves,
programming is the activity by which we write down the steps in the notation that the computer understands.

Euclid's algorithm
a = q x b + r

  a    q    b    r
 136   2    56   24
 56    2    24   8
 24    3    8    0
 
 Challenge: Do this algorithm with emojis.
