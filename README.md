# WorshipPadz
Worship Padz is an app that plays background pads for live worship musicians!
 
Incorporating our app makes your rig extremely light, specially when traveling from gig to gig. 
 
Worship Padz will thicken your worship sound. Our pads are created for worship musicians by worship musicians. These pads are not found anywhere else in the market. Our sound designers created them from scratch with you in mind. It provides a soft atmosphere for live worship musicians and studio recordings. 
 
Worship Padz plays back a looped set of signature synth pads that we created from scratch and have tested in worship environments. Simply tap the key you want and the app will keep playing the pad in that key until you press the stop button.
 
Features:
  - Our signature pad sound in all 12 keys.
  - Stop button that fades out the pad so that there is no abrupt stop when you want to end the pad.
  - Background mode. The pad will continue to play even if you accidentally exit the app, need to look up lyrics/chords, or simply need to do something else on your phone.
  - Visually appealing user interface. Dark color scheme with bright buttons so that you can easily see each button in any environment. 
  - Selected pad turns green so that you always know which key the pad is playing on. 
  - Unique synth pads that only Worship Padz users have access to.
 
How to use this worship pad:
 
Please first understand how live and/or studio musicians use pads in worship music before purchase. 
 
Worship Padz does not contain the major 3rd or minor 3rd note of a chord, and this is done on purpose. This is so that you can use our pads in both major and minor keys. It plays only the 1st, the 5th, and the octave of the key you select.
 
Imagine you are playing with other musicians or solo. All you have to do is select the key that you are playing in. Worship Padz will begin to play the pad on that key. You do not need to change the pad note with each chord change. 

For example, if your song follows the 6-4-1-5 progression (for those that know the number system), the pad technically stays on the 1 as the band goes through each chord of that progression.
 
Once you are done using the pad just tap on the stop button and it will slowly fade out until it stops completely.
